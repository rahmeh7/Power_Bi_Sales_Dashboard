I designed and developed an interactive sales dashboard using Power BI, which enables the user to track and analyze online sales data efficiently. To accomplish this, I utilized complex parameters, filters, and slicers to facilitate drilling down in worksheets and enable customizations.

To ensure the dashboard's effectiveness, I created connections and joined new tables, incorporated calculations to manipulate data, and established user-driven parameters for visualizations. I also used various customized visualizations, such as bar charts, pie charts, donut charts, clustered bar charts, scatter charts, line charts, area charts, maps, and slicers, to effectively display the sales data.

Overall, my work resulted in a professional and user-friendly dashboard that provides clear insights into online sales data, enabling businesses to make informed decisions.
